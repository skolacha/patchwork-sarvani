It was the only escape that didn’t involve unleashing floods of water on my parched throat or sticking my head in our fridge until my mother snuck up behind me, eyes-narrowed, reprimands about electricity-wasting on the tip of her tongue.\nYet the sad truth I have discovered—over the instances I chose to pick up a pen rather than a book and try my hand at writing—is that as I have not attained beloved Indian grandmother status, I’m not always awarded the same affordances as Ms. Murthy. English teachers are not as charmed with the 39th usage of, “Let me tell you a story” as they were the first time you used it. So, instead, I’ll begin my story elsewhere: with a cab driver, three suitcases stuffed full of clothes and Maggi packets, and hands ornately decorated with henna.\n","id":0,"length":183,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"This project is a culmination of my time as an intern at the wonderful publications department at the Getty. Like the blankets my aunt Anu would stitch together, it is a patchwork: comprised of my research on Indian textile histories (particularly Kalamkari from the Coromandel Coast); an outpouring of stories I have heard about my aunts’ own childhoods as well as my memories with them; and extracts from writings by feminist Indian authors who documented and elevated the invisible struggles of married Indian women and mothers so they could be seen (sometimes for the first time).\nI do not exist in isolation. I am a tapestry of my own, woven together by the cultural and artistic heritage I inherited from the women of my family and the feminist scholars and authors of my country. Here, Indian textile histories intersect with my own penchant for art-making and my positionality within Los Angeles’ socio-political landscape. So, reader, as you traverse through this archive of-sorts, remember that everything is intertwined, every strand connected to the other. Ultimately, remember that the importance of this publication is simply the fact that it is here, blinking awake on your computer screen, unfurling under the rhythmic clicks of your keyboard. I am here, holding out these erased, obscured histories for you to see, making up for the ways that they were hidden from me as I was growing up.\n","id":1,"length":232,"title":"Preface","type":"splash","url":"/intro/"},{"content":"There are three things to remember about getting a ride from the airport as a broke college student:\n  Always book ahead—preferably as soon as Lyft will deign to give you a slot—to get the lowest prices.\n  Deck yourself out, head-to-toe, in college merch; the goal here is to look like a walking, talking, mega-cringe advertisement for all of the crappy sweatshirts and overpriced basketball shorts in your campus store. That way, you’re effectively using every inch of skin as real-estate to market your availability to share Lyfts with other broke college students who didn’t have the forethought to book in advance.\n  Like all carefully-laid plans, both steps went out the window once I departed through the glass doors into the hot LA air. Scrambling, I pulled up the familiar app, and twenty minutes later I was sprawled in the back of a (relatively cheaper) Uber from LAX to Westwood at 9am on a Saturday, sweating like an Indian mother flipping parathas on a gas stove in May: not pretty. It was as I was attempting to evaporate the rolls of sweat on my neck simply with the power of my mind, that the driver began to make small talk.\nAfter we’d traversed familiar chit chat territory—LA weather, what college I went to, and the like—he asked me where I was from. I knew that the conversation had been building up to this point, but I still wasn’t ready to share the ambiguity of what ‘home’ meant for me with a relative stranger. Still, I recited my pre-choreographed answer.\n“Oh, well, I was born in the Bay and lived there for a while, but I went to high school in India.”\nThis wasn’t technically true; I’d spent seven years in India, but this, I’d found with trial-and-error, was even harder to understand.\nAnd he was having trouble as it was to wrap his head around this new information.\n“Oh, so you’re from India! Did you grow up there?”\n“No, I’m from the US, just moved there later on.”\n“Oh—a native Californian! O-kay! Yeah, I’ve never been to India, but I heard that everyone is required to go to college there, right?”\n“I mean—I know a lot of people who don’t, but I don’t think—it’s not required, no.”\n“Oh?” He seemed stumped. He paused to edge narrowly around a curb and then glanced back, intrigued.\n“Yeah, I mean—” I was reminded, randomly, of a friend in Singapore, who was required to serve in the armed forces. “it’s not like conscription,” I laughed to soften the blow.\nHe didn’t seem to have heard, rattling off another question vaguely in my direction instead.\n“Oh, well the parents are strict, right?”\n“I don’t know if I would generalize—” I started to say, but he stopped me before I could finish. When he turned around briefly at a stop sign, a light was pinging around in his eyes, as if he was watching his own version of Fast and Furious.\n“I mean, of course, I don’t know much about how it is down there in India, but I know in Asia the parents are often all strict. Was it like that when you were a kid?”\n“Not really, no.”\nHe snapped his head to the road and then back again to make eye contact, probably planning on continuing his line of interrogatory questioning. Instead, he paused, seemingly arrested by the sight of my hands. They were patterned delicately with the mehndi from the cones my cousins had gotten specially imported from Thirupathi.\nThe fine orange-brown lattice traced my wrists, crisscrossing vein-like on the backs of my hands, and truncating at the edges of my fingers. With my arms outstretched, ornate swirls of henna on the slopes and valleys of my skin, I could inhabit a different place: one saturated with memories of my aunts and cousin sisters; dreams of India.\n“What is that?” He asked, pivoting wildly to check on the road when a car behind us honked angrily.\n“It’s called henna”, I said. “It’s like a…liquid, you apply from a cone to create patterns on your hands.”\n“Oh, but it’s not permanent though?”\n“No, no,” I told him.\nHe glanced back, and grinned, relieved. “Good. Pretty girl like you shouldn’t tattoo her hands permanently like that.”\nI smiled back tersely, nausea and indignation colliding in a sick rush in my belly. I didn’t know how to say that this was my culture; that I had felt restless my entire life and drawing attention to the brown of my skin, the delicate frame I’d inherited from my dad’s sisters, the mehendi dripping down my fingers, was the only way to feel like I was on firm ground; that I was worried I’d be a nomad forever, trudging and trudging through an endless, scorching desert. I didn’t know how to say any of that.\nSo instead, I only said, “What a relief!” Then I hunched down into the seat, burying my henna-d skin under my thighs. As though if I squeezed hard enough, they’d turn white.\n","id":2,"length":839,"title":"Beginnings.

Practiced largely along what came to be referred to as the Coromandel Coast, the art form eventually diverged into Srikalahasti and Pedana Kalamkari after the respective areas where it was practiced. The former involved the conventional methods of pen and dye, and often involved the circulation of Hindu motifs (lotus, peacock, etc.).

This history is further complicated by the colonization of India by the Dutch and then the British in quick succession. Soon, the markets were inundated with exports of what came to be called chintz (from the Hindi chint, meaning ‘spotted’ or ‘speckled’). While chintz diverges from kalamkari to encompass any fabric with mordants or resists applied to enable the adherence of dyes to it, the Coromandel Coast was certainly one of the main exporters of the popular cloth. In catering to popular demands, combining French design sensibilities with Chinese porcelain motifs and Dutch aesthetics, kalamkari was an iterative, versatile fabric. It was adaptable to the needs of an ever-shifting market not just because of the artistic brilliance of its painters, but also because of the more fundamental need to survive.\nAs textile scholar Rta Kapur Chishti has said in her TED Talk about Indian fabrics and the sari,\n “it is a garment capable of being refashioned constantly.”\n        Expand   Rectangular cotton rumal (coverlet), painted and resist-dyed, with floral border and cartouches with figures showing courtly pursuits. ca. 1625—1650.Victoria \u0026amp; Albert Museum.

Later, writer George Eliot unintentionally coined the use of ‘chintzy’ to refer to a gaudy, tasteless fabric—thus, with one broad stroke, erasing centuries of Indian and South Asian histories. This aligns with (V\u0026amp;A senior curator) Dr. Rosemary Crill’s explanation that in the late 17th century, chintz was mainly used as ornamentation or decoration of domestic settings, as it “was mainly seen as a feminine, informal, fabric”.\nAs Harvard historian Dr. Sven Beckert puts it,\n “[Chintz] tells a story that is much larger, and often much less pleasant [than writers and European sources like to tell]. A tale of armed trade, colonialism, slavery, and the dispossession of native peoples.”\n Perhaps all that needs to be said on the state of kalamkari today is that, when I went to visit the artisans (spoken for by one of the descendants of the long line of kalamkari artists, Pitchuka Srinivas) in a remote village called Pedana, near Bengaluru, they would never be able to afford the designer dresses by people like Ritu Kumar and Gaurang Shah, adorned by their own chintz designs. Instead, they showed me the Christmas tree blocks and prints inspired by the McDonald’s wrappers they’d seen littering the earthen floors, where once natural dyes were extracted, and plants flowered around the rich soil.\n       Expand   Pink and indigo naturally dyed Pedana Kalamkari sari.Sarvani Kolachana/Ravi Kiran Metaphor Racha Collection.

Often, lotus roundels are described by textile historians in terms of their “uniquely voluptuous and appealing” (Jain, 45) forms that “evoke paradise itself” (Fotheringham, 40). The use of voluptuousness implies a gendered quality, or a sense of sexuality, that enshrouds the motif; in some sense, it may be applied to evoke the sort of sensual pleasure its owners (often European nations which had colonized India) seemed to enjoy through its luxuriousness. Arguably, however, it also reflects a predominantly Hindu understanding of the motif in relation to the Goddess of Prosperity, Lakshmi devi, as a symbol of fertility and beauty. Even today, Hindu families across various regions of India perform Lakshmi puja on the first Amavasya [new moon day] in the Kartik maasam [month of Kartik in the Vikram Samvat Hindu calendar].

Like ornate henna patterns, the meticulously-crafted-repeat leaves little negative space for the eye to rest, and instead points to a dynamic, flowering worldview that is never static. Here, it could be argued, the cosmic macro collides with the detailed, floral micro in a tribute to the visual structure and symmetry of nature.

The vast gaps of negative space starkly diverge from the previous 16th—17th century work. Simultaneously, they act as an imagistic counterpoint to the interwoven lattice-like leaves within the plant, which in turn cohere to a sort of invisible rectangular grid. It appears the internal logic of the lotus has been taken and sectioned off into solitary pieces, for recreation into an ordered design devoid of its overarching construction. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the print manages to both recreate the dynamism and animated quality of the lotus roundel while thwarting the undercurrent of religious appreciation that ran throughout the first work.

My mom and I argue a lot. Like a lot. Enough to prompt my sister to say:\n“At one point, it was like every single day. Morning and evening.”\nSo, I didn’t expect anything to change once I moved to college last year. But in a way—it did. Now, I’m more grateful for the minutes I can steal away to talk to my mom…in between classes…walking to a seminar or waiting to cross the street…on a particularly slow day in the store I work at—don’t tell my manager that!\nSo, yeah. When I’m on campus, my mom and I don’t fight that much anymore. When I come home? That’s…a different story.\n“At first it used to start with you getting moody and Amma giving you a lecture. You would just murmur and not say anything to her face. Like when we were younger. And then became both of you shouting at each other. And now, I think it’s died down a bit.”\n“The last time you came, I was so surprised, cause you guys didn’t fight at all. I think there was just a little squabble for a bit. But you guys didn’t fight at all, so…very impressed.”\nOur arguments have evolved over the years. Sometimes, it makes me feel more mature—instead of her chiding me for leaving my stinky socks in the middle of the room when I come home from school, we bicker ‘intellectually’ now. Like, whether my mom—having grown up in a rural village in India overrun with monkeys and lacking a steady electricity supply—is too conservative for the liberal landscape of California.\nThe other day, we were circling this topic, too afraid to touch down on it. It was a sore subject, a pruned thumb sucked too red and too raw. I eventually pushed, bringing up her village and her mother, and she outright snapped.\nEyes glittering dangerously like a snake poised to strike, she exclaimed, “You don’t know anything about my childhood! You don’t know about Ammamma!”\nSee, I always thought I knew enough about my grandmother: she was the mother of ten children (of which my mother was the youngest); she’d taken a cross-country train trip with me when I was a toddler, and subsequently passed away; my mom looked like her from certain angles.\nAlso, my mom loved saying how ‘ahead of her time’ Ammamma was. That was the kind of thing I might shrug and roll my eyes about. How could someone who’d lived in a rural village in India and spent her entire life as a mother and housewife be ‘ahead of their time’, I’d think?\n“I don’t really know. Because she doesn’t talk about Ammamma that much. Because every time she talks about her, she gets really really emotional. It’s like, ‘she’s my mom, you guys don’t know anything about her!’”\nThat’s my sister—we were both familiar with Amma’s protectiveness of Ammamma. So that’s what I wanted to understand through our conversations: what was so different about Ammamma, and the village my mother grew up in?\nAnd, well, in the quest to answer these questions, I ended up doing something entirely different than learning about Ammamma and my mother’s village. I learnt about my own mom: things I never knew in the nineteen years of being her daughter. And the deeper I went into these stories, an even funnier thing happened: I began to see myself differently, and re-evaluate my own relationship with my mom.\nBut—I’m getting ahead of myself. For now, let’s start at the beginning, with a village overrun with red monkeys, and a great grandmother who couldn’t see.\n   When my mom was seven or eight years old, she spent a lot of time with her grandmother, an elderly, precocious woman whose eyesight and energy had dwindled over the years.\n“She’ll be sleeping most of the time—not sleeping sleeping. She’ll be lying down”\nIndian afternoons were humid, and that house would sometimes feel like a pressure cooker, bringing my mom’s skin to a slow-boil until she couldn’t ignore the sizzling sweat dripping down her back.\n“And there are no ACs. Only one stand fan used to be there, and it depends on the mercy of the electricity board. Sometimes, middle of summer, they’ll take away the electricity. They’ll cut off.”\nNaturally, her grandmother found other methods of coping.\n“So, what she used to do, she used to make all the kids prepare the sandalwood paste. So she will apply to [her] entire face, because she is not able to bear the heat. [And] one hand she will have her hand fan. [And] that is 24/7 it will go. Even [when] the fan is running, her hand is like that.”\nMy mom’s face softens slightly.\n“I used to go and sleep next to her. And with the other hand she’ll pat, so that kids will sleep. [And she has] such a beautiful smell. No perfume [is] equal to that. Very cozy and warm.”\n“So that is my favorite.”\n“I used to buy bananas for my grandmother. While coming [home], one street, one place, there are no houses. And lots of trees. So you know, definitely the monkeys will be there.”\n“So you should be very careful, if they see a little bit of banana, they’ll jump on you. I used to be so scared. I used to look around all the time and if I see a little bit of movement on the trees, I used to run [and] jump into the house. You are helpless, basically.”\nMy mother’s bathroom roof was shared with the neighbors. Often, monkeys would come up and grab something—a sari, a blouse, a sock—off the clothesline and taunt my mom’s family with it. You’d catch the jeering red face through the bathroom window and know: the game was afoot.\n“We will be shouting here with sticks or something. They’ll sign [to] you that I’m going to tear it. If you do anything, I’m going to tear your clothes like this.”\n“Then you need to show them either some rice [or] food. That is a strategic thing. You should put that food in the other direction so that when it comes for that food, you need to go and grab that food.”\n“There is one scary thing I remember. I was maybe 11 or 12 years old.”\nMy mom had placed food up on the roof and waited five minutes.\n“We thought the monkey left. So I went to take it out because I am the youngest in the neighborhood, and whoever is younger, they’ll go and fetch those things.”\n“So the moment I went, what happened? It came like this HISS”\nHer nose wrinkles and her eyes scrunch up into zig-zag lines. She opens her mouth and bares her teeth at the camera. It is maybe the single most terrifying expression I’ve ever seen on my mom’s face. And I don’t want to see it again.\n“So scary! Then what happened? I jumped! From the bathroom roof to down!”\nExcept she had discounted one vital piece of information in her hastily-cobbled-together escape plan.\n“There is a nail on the roof”\n“Oh my God, really?”\n“My full long skirt got cut.”\n“What? Like it swirled around you? Like a tornado?”\n“No, it ripped! [laughing]”\n“Oh! Oh God! [laughing] You got pantsed!”\nMy sister and I’s favorite story is about one particular run-in that my mom had with a monkey.\nIt goes like this: my great-grandmother—my mom’s grandmother—couldn’t see very well.\n“She cannot see really clearly what is there unless it is right next to her. So, she will just touch their hand. And she’ll be like ‘oh, this is so and so.’ Based on the footsteps, ‘oh, somebody came like this.’”\nAnd well, you wouldn’t know it by looking at my sister or me, but my mom used to have really red hair.\n“Uh copper color—not red—copper color. So not bright red.”\nWhile my mom is telling me this, I’m sitting in an office filled with books. As she starts describing the monkeys in her village, she points to a beige tome behind me.\n“They have a—what do you call—not light brown. Beige color. Red at the back.”\nMy great-grandmother, in her later years, would eat a single banana each day. She would eat half in the mornings, and then wrap it back up and tuck it under her pillow before her afternoon naps.\n“Even the monkeys know there will be some banana. So, if nobody is there, they will come inside slowly and they’ll go under the bed and just pick up the banana.”\n“That day, because I’m a baby, they left me to play somewhere. Basically, I crawled under the bed. Because I’m a baby, I’m guessing I may have [not been] fully clothed or whatever.”\n“So, from afar, my grandma saw a red color.”\n“Oh! Immediately she’s like, ‘Oh there is a monkey!’”\n“Oh my god! That’s so scary!”\n“Yeah. And slowly I came out. Luckily they didn’t hit me…with a stick, or something, thinking that I’m a monkey.”\nBut after half an hour of monkey stories like this, the thing that struck me the most wasn’t even how many close-calls my mom had had. No, it was this:\n“You know? They will hit their kids if they are doing something. Yeah, like motikayya [head thump]!”\nMotikayyas are kind of like those playful thwacks on the head you’ll see in TV shows and movies like the Three Stooges—slapstick comedy that my father is especially fond of. When I was younger, my parents would smack me gently as a warning.\nWhat my mom was really trying to tell me was that monkey families operated in the same ways as humans: children piggybacked on their parents, sometimes mothers would do lice checks. It was this sort of universal operating software that came preloaded into primates and humans.\nOr maybe, it was just that we tried to see ourselves in them, to project our own lives the same way I was trying to do by learning more about Amma’s childhood.\nEither way, the resemblance was uncanny. Monkey or not, when children were being naughty…\n“They’ll hit on their head. One good bang!”\n   There’s this scene from this one Bollywood movie my sister and I would watch over and over again, as˜ kids. The movie is called ‘Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham’, which translates literally to ‘Sometimes Happy Sometimes Sad’—it’s more poetic in Hindi, I swear!\nIt’s about a guy named Rahul, played by this really famous actor in India, Shah Rukh Khan, who gets banished from his family because he marries a girl his father doesn’t approve of.\nIn the scene [play noise in background], Shah Rukh Khan’s parents are lured to his city by his younger brother who plans to bring the family together. As soon as the parents’ plane touches down, the mother is hit with the feeling that Rahul is nearby. She has no proof, not a shred of evidence about his whereabouts since they cut off contact. But she is sure of it—you can see the recognition dawn on her face.\n[K3G scene]\nThis, my mom reassures me, is not how her own reunions with Ammamma would go.\n“We used to be [on the] third floor. For Ammamma, she never used to go anywhere. So she used to sit there. There is a road right next—a double road. For her, that is the time pass. She used to just watch the people go, and the street: cars, scooters, buses. And the bus stop is somewhere there.”\n[Sound of traffic]\nIn her imaginary diagram of the window overlooking the street, my mom raises her arms and points to the bus stop.\n“She can see the time when I used to come. So, she used to wait there. I used to walk all the way from there.”\nAgain, my mother gesticulates, tracing with her finger in the air, the distance between her and Ammamma.\n“Like that scene from Kabhi Kushi—”\n“No, not that much”\nWell, there go my hopes of a movie adaptation of this podcast.\n[Music break]\nStill, I can’t help but want something to cling on to—to make this foreign thing seem familiar, a part of my world. Then, when my mom gives me the very thing I want—I don’t believe her.\n“That street you know, right? Kalanjali area, that double—now it is not like that.”\nIn the grainy zoom recording, I can see my eyes narrow in disbelief, one of my eyebrows leaping up. Evidently, my mom catches this too.\n“Yeah! That is exactly the place. I told you so many times.”\n“Amma, did you really?”\n“Hundred and one times. Ask Saranya! [laughing]”\nI checked with my sister about this and apparently my mom was right. Well, she wins round one, I guess!\nThroughout these interviews, I began to realize how much I didn’t know about my mom. And it wasn’t just things like where she lived, or what her dad—my thathaiyya—was like.\n“Some of the father jokes, the dad jokes he used to give.\n“Wait really? I didn’t even know that!”\n“Yeah. He used to make puns. For example, In Telugu they used to say [Telugu joke]. He used to fight: ‘You are wrong. How can you plant a tree? You can plant only saplings. You can grow trees.’”\n“That’s like the jokes Nanna makes!!”\n“Yes! That’s why I said dad jokes [laughter fades]”\nI had missed bigger things, like what Ammamma’s personality was like. How similar she was to my own Amma. What their relationship was like.\nLike, when my mom would come home from college, she would come bearing cloth bags straining at the seams with ripe, juicy fruits, and be met with the sight of her parents playing cards.\n“See, it is a small house, one bedroom house. The entrance will be small. The entrance place is there.”\nAs she tells me, her arms rise again—like a conductor guiding her own invisible symphony—and points to places in this phantom house.\n“One bed used to be there. There, thathaiyya used to sleep. And there, one side is Ammamma’s bed.”\nShe gestures horizontally: they are across from one another. The image rises to my mind, unbidden, of two friends gossiping at summer camp.\n“So, if I come early, they both used to sit and play cards. Because he had some problem with the leg. He met with an accident, so he couldn’t move. He won’t talk much.”\n“So, she used to sit. Their card game is rummy—making sets. But Ammamma is so bad at it.”\nThis exasperated my grandfather, who was an adept card player.\n“’Why are you playing that one?!’ he used to say.”\n“She’s like eh, it’s okay, it’s okay.”\nAmmamma would only play until Thathaiyya won. Then—\n“Ah, okay, okay. She used to mix up the cards! She never showed the cards [laughing].”\nMy mom’s face crinkles up in amusement.\n“Nobody plays with him. I mean, everybody’s busy with their work, and he gets bored. She’s not interested in that, but only for Thathaiyya—for him—she used to play.”\n   “She’s very crafty, even when she’s young”\nMy mom’s face softens when she says this, crows feet gathering faintly at the edges of her eyes. Like she’s gently adrift in a memory.\n“She used to go and do ‘vathulu’ for the lamp. With cotton you take out that—spin that one, right? Like a candlewick. That requires a lot of skill to make it with the hand. She used to do very fast.”\nSometimes, for special occasions or prayer functions, a huge amount had to be prepared in advance to be lit.\n“One lakh of them, imagine. Okay? It needs lot of time—months. So all the ladies in the afternoon time, they will do that together. They used to call my mom. Within ten minutes, she’ll make a hundred or something.”\nA hundred? I tried rolling a wick once when I was in India, and made five, then complained about blisters for a week afterwards!\n“Even after marriage—“\nHere, I have to interject and say that my grandmother got married when she was 12. 12! You know—that age when you’re meant to be a preteen watching Disney channel originals and going to middle school? Any-anyway\n“Even after marriage, she used to stitch a lot of things. And it seems she used to stitch frocks with hand, no machine.”\n“All her patterns are, like, imaginary. Because there is nothing, no books. It is a village.”\n“There’s no Joanne’s, there’s no Michaels!”\n“But my Pedananna [Grandpa] used to get surprised. How can you get all this.”\n“What kinds of patterns would she make?”\n“I mean, latest patterns. These are the latest from Delhi. Delhi is like America for India.”\n“Delhi inside India is like America for India [laughing]. I know what you’re saying!”\nWhat she was saying was that Delhi, with its large pattern books and detailed print tutorials, was remote—a faraway land. My family, including my mother’s side, is all from South India, and Delhi is way in the North. So, for her purposes, Delhi could have been the capital of Tennessee: a place her mother wasn’t going to be able to see anytime soon.\n“Not just embroidery. She used to lots of crafts with paper, she used to do beautiful flowers and decorate the house.”\n“After that, she’s busy naturally. With all the kids, their grandkids, marriages—and she never had time for these types of crafts later.”\nMy mother is the youngest of ten siblings. And it was once my grandmother had seen her kids start their lives, fly off to distant and remote parts of India, start families and have kids of their own, that she found time for herself.\n“And I don’t know from where she had the needle, Ammamma. She started—crochet. Everything she did from memory. She started doing curtains. So for each kid—from one to ten—she made at least one for everybody.”\n“There are 101 patterns in one curtain, because whatever she remembered, she put that design there. It is not coherent.”\n“So she used to do flowers from memory and leave it just here and there.”\nSomething about that strikes me—that this woman, after being married off at 12, having kids pretty much her entire adult life, catering to the whims and needs of others constantly, finally finds time for herself.\nAnd all she wants to do with the time she has is make intricate lace flowers and drop them around the house. As though even after it all, her generosity is overflowing and spilling out, like thread unspooling from a tightly wound ball.\n“Then I said, you have to teach me that. So she is like, okay.”\n“But—as you know—in the beginning, you will be very slow. Everything will fall.”\nMy mom says that matter-of-factly, peering knowingly at me, because she is aware that I share the same experiences as her: I, like my mom, learnt crochet from my Amma.\n“So I used to fight with her. You are so good at it, I’m not good.”\n“She is like, you will get it!”\nThis, too, is a familiar kind of frustration. Both my mom and I are people who want to know something and want to know it now. I feel a small sense of connection, listening my mom talk about her mom, like some kind of intergenerational latch clicks in place.\n“I learned that one basically by admiring the way my mom did. Not what she created. Basically, the admiration for her skill. Looking at her hands, how fast and quick.”\n[Music Break]\n“But the one thing is, that crochet hook and needle is with me. You know, that one is for my memory. She’s like, you are the only one.”\nAs in, my mother was the only one who crocheted.\nEven though I don’t remember my mom talking much about my grandmother, I remember this detail: how much she treasures Ammamma’s parting gifts to her. When we were younger, and technology was still fresh, she used a freelance printing service to design a phone case using a photo of Ammamma’s lace work overlain upon a sari she embroidered. She used to be really proud of it.\n“I stitched on sari, ok, the entire sari. That is a big story.”\nSee, my mom was still a newbie—and like any beginner, she was ambitious, with no skills to match her dreams. So, she bought a cheap fabric, and took it to a shop where a guy could print designs on it—a kind of template for her to follow.\n“I saw one design, I said, ‘ok, you print this one. I am going to stitch.’ Because it’s peacocks. I liked it, and I gave it. I don’t know how it comes.”\nWhen she got it back, she realized she’d made a big mistake.\n“It is such a huuuge design. And six meters I have to stitch—and the sari is so much cross. I have to cut it, and it is not straight!”\n“What did you do?”\n“I gave it, so I have to stitch! I think it took me a year to complete that one.”\nThe secret to her success? Her mother’s incessant nagging!\n“Why don’t you stitch that one? Why don’t you finish that one? So I finished.”\nThis was what she put beneath the last piece of lace her mother had left to her, and photographed to put on her phone case. She has to unearth the memory under layers of history now, when I bring it up.\n“Yeah, yeah yeah—I remember! So as a memory, I put those two things together!”\n“All of this, I think, is because of my mom. Because she used to tell her daughter-in-laws: Not always kitchen work. Do some creative work. For a housewife, you can do always kitchen, cook, and clean. No that is not life. Do something else also.”\n   “I think—Amma wasn’t really close to Ammamma, ok?”\n“What?!”\n“So, when she was first a kid, she had all these other siblings. And obviously Ammamma was busy. And was also old, so didn’t really spend that much time with her. That’s why she says, I was always outside and used to be with my friends all the time.”\n“But at the same time she was the youngest. So she also spent the most time with Ammamma alone.”\n“Yeah, I think when she started working and stuff they got really close. Because she was much older.”\nI’m surprised. I’d never put it together like that, but when my sister lays it out in front of me, it makes sense. But even to my sister, the issue of Amma’s relationship with Ammamma is—cloudy—at best.\n“I don’t know! Like I don’t really know Amma and Ammamma’s—[laughing]—like relationship that well.”\n[Music break]\nWhat my sister really means is that Ammamma’s life revealed itself in the cracks, that our Amma was maybe only beginning to piece it together now, nearly two decades later. So of course she was protective of it—like a jigsaw puzzle that you had just put together that others were trying to rip apart and take for themselves; except that, oh yeah: the stakes were so much higher.\n“Why do you think me and Amma are similar in some way to Amma and Ammamma if like—when we were kids, we weren’t like that. Or like, I was—Oh, I guess I wasn’t close to Amma as a kid, right?”\n“I think as a kid you weren’t that close. I think once you started high school maybe—cause until then, what I remember is you were with your friends or hanging out with me. I feel like when we were kids it was just you and me. Yeah! I feel like you guys got the closest when you went to college. You guys used to talk everyday.”\n“I don’t—do you really think we got closer during college?”\n“Yeah! Distance makes the heart grow fonder. [laughing] Basically. Cause I’m not fond of you, so…”\n“[laughing] Chee. Then how come I’m not fond of you.”\nYeah—that thing my mom does? Getting all sarcastic and jokey when things are too heavy? It’s definitely a family thing.\n[Music Break]\n“Do you think it’s also hard for Amma? Because—like the reason that I think I also grew closer is because I started seeing Amma as a person. And that was jarring for me. But still being someone’s daughter and obviously thinking of them as your mom—it’s kind of like a struggle between seeing them as a fully formed person with their own—just—life and then seeing them as your mom. And do you think that Amma’s still in like, ‘she’s my mom’, and it’s jarring because you also have to see them as a person?”\n“I think it’s always hard to differentiate. It’s even with your teachers, like you’ll see them at school, but then you won’t realize they have an actual life outside when you’re really young. It’s like that with your parents too—you forget that they had a whole life before you.”\n“Yeah, I think she just sees her as a mom. Because Ammamma probably spent most of her life as a mom, you know?”\n“So you’re saying it’s not inaccurate to paint her that way. But she probably got married young, and so she really—her life was her mom. Yeah.”\n“…is a mom. Yeah.”\n[Music Break]\nWhen I play this back for myself now, I notice the things I didn’t realize we were saying during our conversation. How my sister’s tone vacillates between certainty and uncertainty. How my words come out hesitating, because even as I was talking, I was questioning my own memories. And then, when my sister and I come to some sort of conclusion, having the weight of it settle on us—what we miss because we don’t talk about our mom like this, together, very often.\nIs this what it is like for Amma? To have to pull out the memories and try to distinguish the emotional attachment from the truth? Is there even one truth? And then, to have nine other people who you grew up with who probably see it slightly different from you, who had a piece of your mom that you never had. A kind of patchwork, that shifts every time someone adds a new fragment of cloth—some missing history that is foreign to you—the picture keeps moving.\nIs it really so wrong, then, to want to protect your patchwork? The picture that you see, now that the thing that it depicts—this person that you love so deeply and so steadily—is gone?\n","id":9,"length":4457,"title":"iii.

Boteh","type":"","url":""},{"content":"From the Persian boteh motif littering Islamic prayer mats to the ‘trippy’ bandana print during the Summer of Love, paisleys have a long and complex lineage. Deriving from Persian artisans’ imitation of cypress trees, the name paisley is a Western interjection, originating from “the high volume of imitation Kashmir shawls being produced on the Jacquard looms of Europe (notably in Paisley, Scotland…)” (Fotheringham, 49). Realism gave way to geometric abstraction, kalamkari textiles “swiftly losing any element of naturalism as they turned into a pure buta (paisley) shape” (49) through iterative design processes.\nIt is interesting to note how anachronistic readings of the design drip into authoritative scholarly texts about Indian textile history (often missing Indian scholarly voices!). For instance, Fotheringham’s words on the subject reference how “the patterns become psychedelic” (49), an observation that certainly has as much—if not more—to do with the Western hippie movement and the European erasure of South Asian art history (remember: paisley, not boteh), than the artisans who were, designing, block printing and dying this motif, themselves. This is reinforced by the wealth of British scholarship on the subject, and the housing of many of these works within the Western museum-scape (most of my own source images are pulled from the Victoria \u0026amp; Albert Musuem and the Met’s collections). Having lived and travelled within India, as well as having interacted with the descendants of the original artisans who keep the craft alive, it is a tragedy that to truly have access to the form, all kinds of barriers have historically been erected that remain to this day.\nBibliography Entries  ","id":11,"length":264,"title":"The Boteh Motif","type":"essay","url":"/catalogue/boteh/boteh/"},{"content":"The first few images show stylized cypress trees embedded within a familiar complicated visual format. The overarching symmetrical construction, flowering cursive viner bordering the image, fine geometric detailing, and abstraction of natural symbols point to the cloth’s origins. As “a powerfully graphic spear-head, with a need-like trunk balanced on a tiny spray of roots” (Jain, 152), the cypress seems to lend itself to further aesthetic experimentation. Within the cloths themselves, a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors, have all been explored within the repetitive cypress pattern. The spindles emanating from the cypresses on the prayer mats—jagged edges creating a sense of dynamism and movement not unlike the earlier lotus—grow to adorn, or even mark the visual identities of, floral imagery in later works, situating themselves firmly within kalamkari’s history. Additionally, unlike the lotus, which resonates with many cultures, but also Hindu religious mythology in particular, this motif has an Islamic origin (as evidenced by some of the script on these prayer mats) that can likely be at-least partially attributed to Mughal patronage at the time.\nNote the last image, certainly made for a European or Western audience (the inscription is in Armenian), centering a Christ-like figure bearing a cross. He is flanked by stylized cypress trees and bordered by a recognizable vine. Here, it is clear how deeply embedded the cypress was within the visual vocabulary of kalamkari artisans.\nBibliography Entries  ","id":12,"length":231,"title":"Boteh ii","type":"entry","url":"/catalogue/boteh/boteh-ii/"},{"content":"These second set of images show the paisley in its most familiar form. A far cry from the lotuses, floral imagery, and cypresses that its design can be traced to, this paisley consists of a rounded, bulging base, with a tapered swirl at the top. Later, it was often reinterpreted by modern Indian audiences as a motif relating to the mango, considered the ‘Raja of the fruit kingdom’. Often, the lack of contour lines delineating the edges of the paisley, meant that it became a sort of bubble, encompassing various other motifs and patterns. Instead of grounding paisleys in a larger environment (as with the earlier cypress piece), it existed almost entirely as a design element: to be peppered throughout a work, or to border it. This is then mirrored in the introduction of almost shapeless curved, curled, tapered, or jagged forms that were repeated throughout to imply a pattern without necessarily having to have recognizable imagery throughout a work.\nBibliography Entries  ","id":13,"length":162,"title":"Boteh iii","type":"entry","url":"/catalogue/boteh/boteh-iii/"},{"content":" Now I realize that she must indeed have been very attractive. Vestiges of that beauty remain. The skin is fine and delicate, even if it is crinkled like tissue paper. Her arms are still slim and firm, but the hands, with their branching of veins, seem incongruously large for those delicate arms.\n There are a set of pictures—that will never see the light of day, buried deep in the recesses of my GDrive to remain untouched by human hands for the next thousand years, if everything goes to plan—that were taken at my amakaiyya’s [aunt’s] house. You can’t tell from them that they’re taken there, because, as grainy selfies tend to be, they’re low-quality and focus on my face. But I can tell from the angle of one that I’m sitting on the sofa in front of the TV, or from the lighting on another that I am on the balcony overlooking a dusty main road that beats out the cacophonous squeal of auto-rickshaws greeting swerving motorcycles and speeding cars.\nThey’re of me—at 10, at 11 after we’d moved to India, at 13, entering freshman year of high school—growing up. In some, I clutch rolls of sticky brown Cadburies in my fists, change for when the shopkeeper below didn’t have enough one-paisa coins. In others, my hair is cluttered with little strips of paper marking my most recent no-heat-curls obsession.\nMy aunt didn’t have to aspire to beauty the way I did with my dime-a-dozen hairstyles. She just was pretty, in that youthful way that meant even at sixty people were asking if she was the little sister to my mom (who was ten years her junior). She was quiet, like white noise in a soundtrack that you mistake for complete silence. And the family doted on her, bossing her around with directives or pointing out her feminine figure in old sepia-tinted photos. It was as if she was more the idea of someone—pale face, jet-black plaited hair, skirts and saris and the like—than someone herself.\nMy fourteen-year-old self was satisfied with this perception. Anu amakaiyya was the one out of Amma’s sisters who wouldn’t raise her voice at my American absurdities and wouldn’t point out my fractured Telugu. She’d make me Chole Bhatura or jam-on-toast when I liked, or split her packet of Parle G with me. I could stay up till midnight and she’d greet me with a sly, inclusive grin and a cup of Bournvita when I stumbled out of the bedroom, bleary-eyed, at noon. Being her niece feels like being on the inside of this great joke, where she is always laughing with (rather than at) you.\n I discovered Chetan Bhagat for the first time crammed in the shelves of the third bedroom, between bits and bobs and odd-ends; trinkets of a long-forgotten childhood and cassette tapes of DDLJ or KKHH that kindled my hunger for Bollywood films while simultaneously depriving me of the actual experience because of their obsolete-ness. Alas, “Two States” wasn’t nearly as captivating as the bookshelves themselves. They reminded me of that scene in Inception, where Leonardo di Caprio’s body is tipped into water, and suddenly, in his mindscape, water starts pouring, just gushing through every crack in the wood, every hole in the ceiling. And the water keeps coming, keeps flooding until the entire structure unravels.\nAmakaiyya’s cabinets often seemed on the brink of a collapse like this, burdened by the weight of generations of history. But unlike Cobb’s failed dream-sharing experiment, they held up. Even as they seemed to absorb the artefacts of everyone’s childhoods—the little doo-dads we’d leave behind from our countless visits or the art projects I’d restlessly abandon in the cemented rows—they never complained or shirked the task. In that way they resembled their owner, perhaps. Silent and steady; never resentful for the role of caretaker that had been thrust upon them, upon her.\n","id":14,"length":647,"title":"v.

It makes me look like an angry teenage jerk.\n And I wasn’t wrong either.\nWhen I was younger, people used to say I had an anger problem—for a girl, of course, because our standards were different somehow. I’d snap at elderly relatives when they asked me to sing for them, or I’d frown and groan, disrupting the bhajan circles or prayers. Most of this I still stand by; the stuff about household hierarchies or excessive religious devotion that I have to say could fill a book. Maybe one day it will.\nBut there were things that I would say in the heat of the moment, when the blood was pounding in my ears and my hands were clenched in a knuckle-whitening fist, that I regret. After my fights with Amma, I’d sulk in the bedroom until amakaiyya’s gently-reproachful figure appeared in the doorway. Even at eight, when the bed-wetting years weren’t far enough away to be a fond memory yet, she would talk me through it logically. She didn’t shout in that condescending, quintessentially-parental way my mom did, or threaten me like a toddler, like some of my aunts. She just prodded me until I confessed to my own guilt, or else calmed me down from my raging, non-verbal state until I was ready to talk.\nAnd for a long time amakaiyya was like this: a silly cross between my therapist and a second mother.\n The Sri Sisters were model children, the good betas, cream of the crop. Then…they grew up.\nThat’s how my mom used to tell it, tongue-in-cheek, giggling mischievously at Anu amakaiyya’s daughters when they scowled playfully at her.\nThere’s Sridevi akka, for whom her pinni [my mom] is like a second mother. There’s Srilekha akka, who for years was my favorite and would give me baths and play with my sister and I when we were younger. There’s Chinni akka, the one who doesn’t hesitate before unleashing a full arsenal of witty quips on you, who told me to call her if I ever got bored in America when I moved back for college.\nTo talk about my amakaiyya is to talk about the Sri Sisters. They’ve lived so many lives by now: as children in a ramshackle one-bedroom apartment in Bombay, where if the youngest daughter took too long to eat dinner, everyone slept late that day because the dining table was also the bed was also the living room floor; as teenagers flitting off to different states and to companies where they would meet their spouses and start their own lives; as young women grieving the loss of their father—women who called their mother every day in the evenings, sometimes twice if their kids had won possession of the phone briefly; as mothers and wives and (sometimes) working women who still need their Amma sometimes to give them advice or watch the grandkids.\nSo, I grew up knowing my amakaiyya through the ghostly residue, the indelible imprint, she’d left on her children. I grew up knowing the amakaiyya who would never tire of my questions about the Hindi soap they were all watching—why was the heroine angry at that man, why was everyone so surprised to see that kid, why, why, why—even when one of the sisters forgot to listen to me or struggled to condense the plot.

At around 5 am, I awoke groggily, in phases, to a sort of steady, comforting presence by my side. Aries—my roommate’s black cat—tilted his head at me, softly twitching his tail in the rising twilight. Then, we locked eyes, and he blinked slowly, as if to say—according to that one TikTok I watched—I love you. I blinked back, and we sat side-by-side, watching the sun wake up and cast golden rays—long and searching—onto our living room floor, our coffee table, the couch.\nThat’s the best way I can describe how safe amakaiyya makes me feel.

Whether through crackling phone lines or rushed visits to Secunderabad on weekends between unending days in classrooms, her crafty-side was our immediate point of connection as niece and aunt. Even now, when I dial twelve hours into the future—PST to IST—to talk to her, the first thing we do is a recap of the projects we’re working on. The other day, as her grainy Whatsapp video was blipping in and out, I told her about the sweater I was knitting. In return, she told me about the table runner she sowed and the dress she was working on for her youngest grandchild (Sridevi akka’s daughter), Shrestha.\nThen, when my mom came back from India with a suitcase full of goodies in April, a cloth tumbled out: the runner I had complimented a couple of weeks ago, soft to the touch and sewed up seamlessly, with no loose ends.\n Late at night in amakaiyya’s house, if you ventured out into the dining room to grab a cup of water, the hum of the sowing machine—operated almost effortlessly by amakaiyya’s deft fingers—would envelop you. The tight and precise jerks of her hands across the cloth, the way her lips would purse around thread, how her wrists would flick dramatically out and in, as if she were a showman putting on her own private act—it’s all etched into my memory. The moonlight would veil the house, transforming it into amakaiyya’s personal sanctuary: the grandkids had finally dropped their toys and fallen asleep, the daughters and assorted in-laws had scattered to their homes or were curled around their children, there was no more cooking or cleaning or conversation-ing. In all my years of being her niece, sowing is the only thing I have seen amakaiyya do that is remotely for herself.\nI would hop up onto the couch—upholstered three times over—and drum my heels in the darkened living room.

Large hanging textiles…popularly featured a single flowering tree…rooted in a stylized base at the centre of the cloth with blooms branching off the main trunk” (Fotheringham, 49). Here, Fotheringham refers to what is often called the Tree of Life. It is a lush, visually complicated culmination of motifs—floral and faunal—and technique. As Jain describes, the “monumental, imaginary trees…[represented a] fusion of Indian, European, and Chinese motifs…[which] resembled wild and colourful under-sea organisms” (154). Often, these motifs strike a precarious balance between overwhelming and rejuvenating the audience with their wild, blooming designs and vividly saturated palettes. These patterns would adorn the interiors of a house or take their places on women’s garments.\nOften, the trees would be flanked by creatures such as peacocks, or the elegant hamsas (swans), which evoked the image of paradise. This resonated strongly with the Islamic conception of heaven, which “is symbolized by a lush green garden full of exuberant flowers” (Fotheringham, 40). The swirling, curvaceous forms created an upward rhythm to guide the viewer’s eye and ostensibly to inject a note of expansiveness within a wall tapestry. The agile, dexterous motion of the block printer’s hand in carving the print translates into light, fine lines that seem invisible at first; the overall effect is that the motifs seem suspended, weightless, in the air, creating a compelling combination of graphic expressiveness and naturalism.

He would climb up on all the pots when everyone was asleep. It was like a slickly choreographed symphony, then, what happened next (every book, every Tinkle double digest, every Amar Chitra Kada would tell it the same). CRASH! The bleary blinks of abruptly awoken villagers. The tittering of mothers as they realized what had transpired while they were dreaming.

But the funny thing was, amakaiyya would get the same look on her face sometimes: lips curled around a laugh, eyebrows raised, eyes glittering. When the neighborhood kids would come play football with my cousin Suchir (her grandson), that’s what she would look like. And they would confuse her for one of the others, kick around the ball in the garden for hours until it got stuck in a tomato plant or chamanti pouo up on the terrace.

Then, when she was back in the kitchen, the fragrant smell of basmati and Bisebellebath wafting through the clumpy air, Saranya suggested we stack the pots.

I couldn’t overcome the shame of that day: it followed me like the sun’s gaze beating down on my neck that Indian summer afternoon.\n Then, the other day, when I asked amaikayya about it, she cracked up so hard she had to wipe away tears with her saree pallu, tassels sweeping across her face in broad strokes.\n“Paapam Sujatha!” She exclaimed, voice dripping nectar. “Your daughter is shoooo shweet and protective of you!”\nWell, that was that, I guessed, swatting away her sarcastically tender caresses as my mom grinned cheekily. That memory seemed altered somehow; transformed by their peals of amusement.\nIn a flash of remembrance, I pictured amakaiyya pushing my mother towards the bathroom threateningly. Her lips were red with the effort of biting them: as though she were stifling laughter.\n","id":19,"length":700,"title":"vii. Papai Amakaiyya ii.","type":"essay","url":"/catalogue/papai-2/"},{"content":"Phone calls with Papai amakaiyya always circle a familiar loop: like the train home from Kacheguda station to HITEC city, or the weekly circulation of curries in our household (bendakaiyya, aloo fry, the occasional dondakaiyya kurra). A slick, well-oiled machine, with all parts humming along smoothly. Dependable.\nFirst, after a bit of small talk about Alia Bhatt’s recent short size (“five inches above the knee is just absurd!”) or the latest Nani movie to come out of Tollywood, I ask her about her garden. She asks me about university. I say I miss India; she says to come visit. I tell her about my internship, she is grateful that it is paid; she tells me about my Smitha akka or her grandson, Suchir, a football [Americans, read: “sawwwcur”] player. Then, we land on some variation of the same joke where she promises to send over some gold jewelry or a pattucheera with a gold-embroidered jari and I hit back with a sly comment that she talks over in her enthusiasm to get out a good joke. We collapse into self-indulgent giggles—thinking too much of our own wit—and I tell her I’m handing the phone back to Amma.\nShe praises my Telugu, tells me to take care of myself, and—maybe it’s a trick of the fragmented phone connection—I hear: “I love you, I miss you, don’t forget home.”\n Beneath the jokes are the memories unfolding in every direction like thread spooling out from a handloom. Sometimes, I gather the threads of history, remembering the agility of her hands—hands mapped with the callouses of motherhood and freckles of age—as she embroidered a paisley onto a green sari blouse; remembering the dexterity of her fingers as she clipped the pallu to her shoulder, a safety pin tucked between pursed lips; remembering how she would tell Ashok to set aside two khadi pieces for her and her sister when they would go to the shops the next day.\n Indian sari shops are like a two-hour long re-creation of the experience of getting stuck under your mother’s sari pleats every time you attend a wedding. Mostly all the ladies just lean together with their heads pillowed on judgmental palms, talking about the neckline of a blouse that would look good with that jari or the likelihood the green cloth to the side there is khadi. I would steal Amma’s phone off her clinking, bangled hand and, in the domed world of her underskirt, play Temple Run.\nThere are also rules: If you so much as breathe in the direction of a particular red silk, the shopkeeper whisks it off the shelf and unfurls it in your face, like a cow’s tongue coming out to lick you before retreating hastily back to the roof of the mouth. And like a cowshed, eegas would hover around the sweaty shopkeepers’ faces, their buzzing drowned out by the persistent whizzing of completely non-functional, power-cut-inducing fans. If India was picked up and dragged about eight degrees north longitudinally, out of the tropics, we’d probably have a steady flow of electricity throughout the summer.\nAnyway, while I’d tap and prod at the figure on screen, attempting to beat my record with the skinny stick-like man in the cowboy hat, Amma and amakaiyya would pore over saris. The muted sounds of people bargaining for auto-rickshaw rides and the beeps of cars attempting not to ram into people—or each other—became the soundtrack to the sari-selection process. As light filtered through Amma’s petticoat, would see flashes of veiny hands, skin folded over like sari pleats, tracing the cloth; sweat coiling at the nape of amakaiyya’s neck; the smirking questions she tossed the shopkeeper’s way.\nThen, how we’d huddle together in the auto home, her slender fingers gripping the sari bag, back ramrod straight against the peeling upholstery of the seat (amakaiyya wasn’t the kind of person to slouch or droop). How shed open her beerva—a sandalwood-scented cabinet worn soft and gentle after years of use—and hang the saris up or deposit them in neat stacks inside. How I’d lay on the bed, stomach to the sheets, legs crossed in the air, eyes closed; letting the rhythms of her voice pass over me, trance-like. How she’d remember about a recent embroidery project or stitch she had tested out and pull them out to toss up into the air and then onto the bed, to show me while I nattered on about my most recent crochet project. How we’d repeat this ritual for years, through puberty and then high school and college applications and university; through shitty WhatsApp connections and Saturday afternoons after a filling portion of rava dosa and chutney, during those hot summer evenings in the talcum-scented air.

Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles  As we reach the end of our patchwork quilt, note this, reader: to attempt to summarize kalamkari with the term ‘feminine fabric’ does a disservice to the hundreds of artisans who have contributed to the evolution of the art form over thousands of years. The story I have retold here is a small, subjective reading of a vast, sprawling history.\nWhat can be said, is that women from all over the world were responsible for kalamkari’s popularity, in ways that both uplifted and endangered the original artisans. Now, the makers of these incredible cloths are all invisible, washed away by the imposition of Eurocentric texts and Western lenses that have fed scholarly debate for the past decades. Only now are Indian voices re-emerging, taking back the narrative.\nSo as a tribute to the imaginary women who may have labored over these cloths and inserted their own lives into these fabrics, I want to repeat textile scholar Rahul Jain’s words here:\n“These textiles [may have] carried subtle imprints of women’s domestic and communal lives and, in some ways, of their temperaments and personalities. The design of these cloths was expressed in a graphic visual language that often transcended narrow religious, political, and cultural boundaries. The motifs [may have] reflected the rites and beliefs that governed women’s roles as daughters, wives, mothers, and sisters, as well as the symbols and narratives of their religious faith, and the real and imagined worlds they inhabited in their daily life, work, and recreation” (228).\n","id":21,"length":264,"title":"viii.
