I want to thank my supervisors, Ruth Lane and Erin Dunigan, as well as Greg Albers and Torrey Manz, for helping me put this project together.

Thank you also to Leslie! As Van Gogh said, 'artists should definitely copy' (or something like that), and Leslie was a great person to copy off of. '

Thank you to everyone who I worked under and this department as a whole! I have had a wonderful ten weeks here and I am sad to go.
