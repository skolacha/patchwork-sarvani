A lotus motif “is symbolic of purity, beauty, knowledge, and enlightenment. Identifiable by its layered set of petals, though abstracted by artists in myriad ways, it has sacred connotations for Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs” (Fotheringham 2019, 40).

Along the Coromandel coast, intricate lotus designs were often created by seamlessly interlocking carved wooden blocks. Through their symmetry and geometric floral designs, lotus roundels lent themselves to aesthetic abstractions, “generating the region’s most potent formula for visual design: the mandala, yantra, or chakra” (Jain 2011, 45).

Often, lotus roundels are described by textile historians in terms of their “uniquely voluptuous and appealing” (Jain 2011, 45) forms that “evoke paradise itself” (Fotheringham 2019, 40). The use of voluptuousness implies a gendered quality, or a sense of sexuality, that enshrouds the motif; in some sense, it may be applied to evoke the sort of sensual pleasure its owners (often European nations which had colonized India) seemed to enjoy through its luxuriousness. Arguably, however, it also reflects a predominantly Hindu understanding of the motif in relation to the Goddess of Prosperity, Lakshmi devi, as a symbol of fertility and beauty. Even today, Hindu families across various regions of India perform Lakshmi puja on the first Amavasya (new moon day) in the Kartik maasam (month in the Vikram Samvat Hindu calendar). Though floral imagery is often tied to notions of femininity across cultures, viewing the lotus roundel as the seed that led to abstracted Mughal flower patterns helps account for the latter’s ties to the idea of womanhood within India and South Asia.
