In these first early works, the iterative patterning within the petals is evidence of the block-printed nature of the textile fragment, though the colors may have been applied by hand. Like ornate henna patterns, the meticulously-crafted-repeat leaves little negative space for the eye to rest, and instead points to a dynamic, flowering worldview that is never static. Here, it could be argued, the cosmic macro collides with the detailed, floral micro in a tribute to the visual structure and symmetry of nature. The indigo and alizarin dyes are applied in a complex process involving mordants and resists that result in a brilliant and vivid image, which has—admittedly—faded and weathered over time.
