From the Persian boteh motif littering Islamic prayer mats to the *trippy* bandana print during the Summer of Love, paisleys have a long and complex lineage. Deriving from Persian artisans’ imitation of cypress trees, the name paisley is a Western interjection, originating from “the high volume of imitation Kashmir shawls being produced on the Jacquard looms of Europe (notably in Paisley, Scotland…)” (Fotheringham 2019, 49). Realism gave way to geometric abstraction, kalamkari textiles “swiftly losing any element of naturalism as they turned into a pure buta [boteh or paisley] shape” (49) through iterative design processes.

It is interesting to note how anachronistic readings of the design drip into authoritative scholarly texts about Indian textile history (often missing Indian scholarly voices!). For instance, Fotheringham’s words on the subject reference how “the patterns become psychedelic” (49), an observation that certainly has as much—if not more—to do with the Western hippie movement and the European erasure of South Asian art history (remember: paisley, not boteh), than the artisans who were, designing, block printing and dying this motif, themselves. This is reinforced by the wealth of British scholarship on the subject, and the housing of many of these works within the Western museum-scape (most of my own source images are pulled from the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Metropolitan Museum collections). Having lived and travelled within India, as well as having interacted with the descendants of the original artisans who keep the craft alive, I mourn the erasure of kalamkari history for thousands of years.
